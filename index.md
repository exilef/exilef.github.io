Hi, my name is Felix Effenberger.

I am a mathematician (PhD) and computer scientist by training, turned neuroscientist, turned entrepreneur.

After my PhD, I worked as a [postdoctoral researcher](/cv) in the field of [computational neuroscience](/research) at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig and at the [Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute for Neuroscience](https://fias.institute/) and [Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies](https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/) in Frankfurt for several years.

In 2017, I decided to join a stealth startup in San Francisco to start working on novel, neurally inspired video compression techniques, for which I work still.

My research interests are in neuroscience, mathematics, data analysis, and machine learning, fields in which I [published some papers and book chapters](/research).

I am also interested in creating [open source software](/software).
