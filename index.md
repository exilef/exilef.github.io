Hi, my name is Felix Effenberger.

I am a mathematician (PhD) and computer scientist by training, turned neuroscientist, turned entrepreneur.

I work as freelance software engineer / data scientist / researcher / trainer, located in Germany (with stints to San Francisco).

Previously, I was CTO at a stealth Silicon Valley startup in San 
Francisco (which I continue to advise), and [worked as postdoctoral researcher](/cv) in the field of [computational neuroscience](/research) for several years.

My research interests are in neuroscience, mathematics, data analysis, and machine learning, fields in which I [published some papers and book chapters](/research).

I am also interested in creating [open source software](/software).
